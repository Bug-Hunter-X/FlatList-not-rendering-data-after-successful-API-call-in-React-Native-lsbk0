# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call.  The `DataFetch.js` file contains the buggy code, while `DataFetchSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The application fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint.  The API call is successful, and the data is correctly fetched into the component's state. However, the FlatList component remains empty, not displaying the fetched data. This is a frequently encountered issue, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations and updates to component state.

## Solution

The issue often stems from a lack of proper state management and the timing of data updates.  The solution in `DataFetchSolution.js` addresses this by ensuring the data is properly rendered once the `isLoading` state changes to `false`, indicating that data fetching is complete.
